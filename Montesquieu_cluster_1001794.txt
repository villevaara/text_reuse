 a free will, and must consequently be either conducted by the light of his own mind or by the caprices of fancy; it necefari- ly follows that every one muff either look upon all religion with indifference, by which means they must be led to embrace the eftabliflied religion; or that they must be zealous for reli- gion in general, by which means the number of secs mufl be increased. It is not impossible but that in this nation there may be men of no religion, who would not, however, bear to be obliged to change that which they would chufe, if they cared to chufe any; for they would immediately perceive that their lives and fortunes are not more peculiarly theirs, than their manner of thinking, and that whoever would deprive them of the one, might, even with better reason, take away the other. If, amongst the different religions, there is one that has been attempted to be established by methods of slavery, it mufft there be odious; because as we judge of things by the appendages we join-with them, it could never present itself to the mind in con- junction with the idea of liberty. The laws against those who profcfs this religion could not, Jiowever, be of the sanguinary kind; for liberty can never in- flia flit these forts of punishments; but they may be so rigorous as to do all the mischief that could be done in cold blood. It is possible that a thousand circumstances might concur to* give the clergy so little credit, that other citizens may have more. Therefore, instead of separating themselves, they have chose rather to support the fame burdens as the laity, and, in this refpe&, to make only one body with them: but as they al- ways seek to conciliate the refped of the people, they diftinguifli themselves by a more retired life, a conduc more reserved, and a greater purity of manners. The clergy not being able to protet religion, nor to be pro- tecOed by it, nor having power to constrain, seek only to per- fuade: their pens, therefore, furnish us with excellent works in proof of a revelation, and of the providence of a Supreme Being.
